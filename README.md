Description:

This project aims to create a mobile application where shopkeepers have an app that shows QR code and users can scan this QR code which will automatically add that user to the visitor list. As a result, the process of manual entry of contact details into the shop database due to COVID-19 would be automated.

## Elements

- QR code generator and scanner
- User account generation with basic detail
- Merchant and customer view
- Daily visitor summary

### User Information
- Profile pic (indicates carrier/primary-contact/not a contact)
- Name
- Email
- Pincode
- Mobile Number
- Vaccine status
- Carrier/primary contact/not a contact
- Address (of shops)

## Features 
- Sign-in using mobile number verification
- QR code generator and scanner
- Normal will be able to view all shops he/she has visited on a given day.
- Shops would be able to view all customers who viisited on a given day.
- Users can edit their profile info.
